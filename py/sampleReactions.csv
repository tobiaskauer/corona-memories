"What's even more surprising is the inflation of college textbook prices. About 10 years ago the Gates foundation did a study that showed most community college students were spending more for their textbooks then they were for tuition, and that the second highest reason for either dropping out of college or not matriculating to college what is the cost of textbooks. Another thing about colleges is that roughly 70 to 75% of all new hires now our ad junked professor's with no path to tenure and who often teach at two or three universities or colleges trying to knit together enough income to stay alive. They don't even receive benefits. Another thing about colleges is that roughly 70 to 75% of all new hires now our adjunct professors with no path to tenure and who often teach at two or three universities or colleges trying to knit together enough income to stay alive. They don't even receive benefits. On top of that consider that the administrative structure of most colleges and universities as increased by roughly 30 to 35%, sucking away the instructional infrastructure of those colleges. Back to college textbooks. Little known is that the majority of college textbook stores are owned by private companies like Nebraska book co., Barnes and Noble, or the Follett corporation. Little known is that the private bookstores kick back a small portion of their profit to college administrators who use the money to run their favorite programs. This is one of the reason it has been so difficult to get colleges and universities to actively and enthusiastically promote open licensed textbooks, which are far less costly and often free to the student. The whole thing is looking more and more like a scam and it's going to be interesting to see how COVID-19 goes toward disrupting many of these institutions, most of whom are grossly overpriced and many of whom deliver a little value for money spent"	opinionsareus
"What does area of smoke mean? What density of particulate matter qualifies as \"smoke?\" How much of this is visible smoke?"	AmadeusHumpkins
"I live along the east coast of Australia in an area not directly affected by the fire but heavily impacted by the smoke. Without detracting from the people who are losing homes in affected areas and obviously have it much worse.... this smoke is fucking horrendous. We‚Äôve had multiple days where we‚Äôve had the worst air quality in the world. Just about every single day from the beginning of December smoke has choked the city, stinging your eyes and making your nose and throat itch. On the bad days it‚Äôs so thick you can‚Äôt see 25m into the distance and even inside office buildings and homes there‚Äôs a smoky haze. It‚Äôs fucking oppressive. It‚Äôs something that affects so many aspects of normal life. I‚Äôve been waiting weeks for an opportunity to wash sheets but can‚Äôt because there‚Äôs no point in hanging them out in the smoke. The smoky air is so hazardous that health officials are telling people to avoid exercise and stay indoors, I‚Äôm itching to get outside and go for a swim or ride my bike but I can‚Äôt. We‚Äôve had relentlessly hot days, made worse by the fact that the smoke is so thick you can‚Äôt crack a window open at night which leads to many sleepless nights when you don‚Äôt have air con. Hospital admissions for respiratory issues have increased. The whole coast is burning, when usually at this time of year half the city is on holiday down there so we‚Äôve all had to cancel holiday plans. I know it‚Äôs a trivial thing to complain about smoke and cancelled holidays when fire is a much more pressing threat, but it really is genuinely depressing. Especially when there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any end in sight, and you worry this is just the new normal. I will never take for granted clean air that doesn‚Äôt burn your eyes and make you feel sick ever again."	kindreddovahkiin
"Just to give you some context folks, yes this is bad. Very bad, especially for the wildlife and humans affected. &#x200B; But by comparison to average North American forest fires which happen every 2-3-4 years, this affects an area roughly four times the size of the largest forest fire in modern history, the 1950-51 Chinchaga fire in Alberta, Saskatchewan and NWT - [which produced so much smoke it blotted out the sun in the eastern US at noontime, and created hazy, smoky visibility in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchaga_fire). The affected area is roughly EIGHT times the size of the 2016 northern Alberta Fort MacMurray fires. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_fires\_in\_Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fires_in_Canada) Now of course vegetation across much of Australia is rather sparse compared to the combustible material of an average boreal forest.

"So I did a little rough math to compare this to the US, may have made a mistake somewhere. Oregon is 255,030 km ¬≤ . The burnt area would be about 23% of oregon. The smoke coverage being 5.5mill km ¬≤ would cover approximately all of: Washington Oregon California Idaho Nevada Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona Colorado New Mexico North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Kansas Oklahoma Texas Minnesota Iowa Missouri Askansas With about 40,000km ¬≤ left over to almost cover half of Louisiana.

People don't get a check for $1000 and think \"Oh I guess I'll go sit down a restaurant now or go to a bar and get a drink or visit a local coffee shop or go shopping at the mall.\" They're going to continue to sit at home and wait out this plague."	datterberg

A couple of thoughts that might be interesting to look at: 1) Trending the number of self-employed/single owner-operator businesses, contractors and gig workers against this.

"I am still looking for a \"total unemployed\" chart. Everyone is showing initial claims for shock value, but the truth is, during 9/11 and 2008, there was a slow burn for layoffs. This time, there is a sudden shock, since this affects everyone equally everywhere, there is no \"propagation delay\". Initial claims is not really actionable information. What does 3.3 million mean in terms of total unemployment?"	haemaker
"This graph is gonna be in history books"	windowtosh
"In my opinion the last frame alone would've been enough to showcase how insane this week was."	federush
"So here's some important context: The primary driver of major layoffs is typically economic recessions, which occur over a span of time; Different companies peter out at different rates and lay off their staff gradually as their income dwindles. Quarantine was a hard shut off for businesses. You either can work from home, and the company can generate revenue with employees from home, or you just can't. So instead of these layoffs spreading over weeks or months, they are all stacking up at once."	MkVIaccount

"If it's \"from day of first death\", why do most bars start at 0? Shouldn't they have (at least) 1 by the end of day 1? Swine Flu (2009) had 0 deaths all the way until day 27. edit: I checked OP's raw data for swine flu.

"I worked at Blockbuster corporate as a contractor in 2003-2004. At the time, I said Blockbuster was going to be bankrupt in 3 to 5 years. It took 5 years and 6 months. They had two main problems. First, they were part of Viacom who spun them off in 2003. They stripped everything valuable out of it and sent it off with an unserviceable amount of debt. Second, there was an incredible \"fear of failure\" culture within upper and middle management. It was better to not take chances and to let someone else screw up than it was to actually innovate. Things were changing, but no one at Blockbuster wanted to take the chance to adapt. Netflix had DVD subscription, and even in 2004, it was clear someone was going to develop streaming. Blockbuster had no plans for that. They basically said, \"We can add subscription!\" and built a dozen warehouses to do what Netflix was already doing very well. The combination of huge debt plus inability to take chances or plan for the future killed them. &#x200B; EDIT: spelling misteak"	RandomName39483

"Peak Blockbuster was 2005. Perhaps not coincidentally that's the year a buddy and I caught up on The Sopranos by him ordering the DVDs through mail using his Netflix account. Netflix adapted shortly after by transitioning to streaming service. Blockbuster tried orders through mail if I remember correctly, but by then that was a step behind and already it was too late."	markfire9
"For those of you too young to remember, the video store routine was every Friday night you'd go to blockbusters with friend or family and pick a couple movies and a video game for under $20. The experience would take about half an hour or so, and you literally browsed a physical library of art, media, and merchandise. Then the following Sunday or Monday you would drop off your rentals. In later years rental periods were extended to the following Friday. What I miss the most is the ritual. Browsing the store was itself it's own activity and felt like you were getting out of the house and doing something fun. I also feel like it was easier to get exposed to media you normally won't see now because of the algorithms. The stores carried everything, and it is still the best way to experience video games."	CountingWizard
"I think people think of Blockbuster as a failed company. I see it as a extremely successful company that ran it's course and gave way to innovation. Not every company needs to last in perpetuity.

"There is actually a fixed diamond vein below y:16 per chunk. If you mine the entire 16x16x16 area, assuming that your diamond vein didn‚Äôt disappear to lava, **got erased by a cave system, got eaten up by other blocks such as gravel**, or got glitched under bedrock, you will always find one diamond vein. The luck comes from stumbling upon one rather than having one spawn. Edit: As seen below, experimentally around 70% of diamond veins live while around 30% get replaced by another block. [Heres a good link explaining why you are not guaranteed to have one diamond vein per chunk.](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/188877) It mostly boils down to structures like lava pools and caves overlapping and removing the diamond vein. I actually did a few experiments, I repeatedly stripped an area of ~~7x7~~ **8x8** chunks and found 45-47 diamond veins every time. I believe the ~~2-4~~ **17 - 19** missing diamond veins may have been replaced with a lava pool, got glitched under bedrock, **been eaten up by gravel, or have been erased by a cave system.** There were no structures such as dungeons or mine-shafts below y:16 in the area stripped. I am not sure if gravel takes priority over diamonds in the world generation process. Regardless, around 70% of the chunks actually had a diamond ore vein. In the experiment above, around 30% of diamonds got replaced by something else. [Here is one image sample of a stripped 8x8 chunk.](https://imgur.com/a/AyoM8qw) Edit 2: The WorldStripper mod I used actually stripped an 8x8 area rather than a 7x7 area, so I have updated the numbers above. I have also added some insight from the comments below. Diamonds and most other ores are coded as CountRange, meaning they spawn a certain amount per chunk rather than have a spawn chance itself. For diamonds this value is 1, which is the rarest. There is a ChanceRange feature that modders can use which gives the chance for one ore vein to spawn in a single chunk, allowing for an ore rarer than diamonds. Anything below 100% chance is rarer than diamonds. Source: I‚Äôm an amateur Minecraft modder."	XXpussydominator69XX

Like from $15 million to $13.9 million? It's always an estimate. And the $62 billion is at the very top of every asset's estimate. And if he needed to sell all his stocks... who would buy them? It took him decades to acquire. Trying to sell them all in one day... no market exists for that. It's all about supply and demand. Flooding the market with even his most liquid asset (stocks) would decrease the value of them tremendously. So the $61.8 billion isn't as real as Pete's $100,000."	Southernbelle5959

"Worth pointing out that most of the \~$900b for businesses is in the form of loans, while the $560b for individuals is just cash. Edit: a lot of people are saying that the cash for individuals will come out of next year's tax refund, but I haven't seen anything to that effect in any major publication. Do any of you have a source for that? Edit again: The cash for individuals is technically based on your 2020 returns, but since we don't know what those are yet, the government is guessing based on your 2019 or 2018 returns. From the Washington Post: >You do not have to pay the government back. Technically a person‚Äôs 2020 income is what qualifies them for the payment. Since no one knows their total 2020 income yet, the government is using tax returns from 2019 and 2018 to figure out who qualifies for a check. If you get a payment and then your 2020 income is higher and thus merits a reduced payment or no payment, the money does not have to be paid back. This does *not* mean that the money you receive this year will have to be paid back in the form of a reduction on next year's refund.

"To all of those asking \"How can the price be negative?\" When they're referring to \"oil prices\" what they're actually referring to is Oil Futures, which is similar to a contract. Oil Futures pricing is based on a number of things, one of them being the C-O-C or the Cost-of-Carry. Because oil is a commodity (i.e. a physical, tangible thing you can touch, unlike digital currency), you have to be prepared to store it somewhere in the event that the person on the other side of that contract decides they'd like that 1,000,000 barrels of oil instead of the $ value of those barrels of oil. So let's say you have a car you put into a storage unit and that car is worth $10,000. If tomorrow that car is suddenly worth nothing, you still have to pay to store it in the unit. This is the same as what we're seeing with oil. Someone still has to take what's already been pumped, refine it, barrel it, and store it somewhere, but its value is technically worthless. So to answer those questions of \"Do they owe me money?\" No, that's not how that works. That just means the people on the \"Supply\" side of those futures contracts are losing their entire investment instead of just a % of. Unfortunately much of the world's economy is backed by Oil Futures in some way shape or form."	PENNST8alum

"I don't usually post much on Reddit but I think I should clear up much of the confusion regarding the situation in Italy. I'm a researcher in Lombardia (the first and most affected region of the country) so I can give a clearer perspective on the situation. - Population density First of all many people here talk about population density in Italy being higher than in the USA: This is true but misleading, as Italy's population is much evenly spread than in the US making the effective density in US cities much more dangerous for the citizens and the more rural areas much safer. Moreover, the epicenter of the outbreak is not the city of Milano, which has a high population density, but the city of Bergamo that has a population density of ~400ppl/km2. Besides, the start of the outbreak was found in a couple of smaller cites with a low-density population and with sparse connections between citizens. All of this means that low population density will not protect the US from a quadratic growth of the cases and you should not take it so easy. - Government Response Another argument that is seeing a lot is about how Italy reacted poorly to the emergency and other countries will not make the same error. This is FALSE: Italy was caught by surprise by the virus due to being the first European nation strongly affected by it, however, the government reacted incredibly well after the first week and the measures are taken are very strong and hardly being taken into consideration by other nations. To make you understand: In Lombardia: - Universities and schools closed three weeks ago - The whole region was declared a yellow zone with strong restrictions on gatherings and activities** two weeks ago** - Also two weeks ago the most affected villages were declared red zones with no people going in or out for two weeks - The entire Lombardia was declared red zone this week, shortly followed by the whole country - Any public event is suspended (**soccer included**) - No Pub, Bar, gym or public-facing business (except essential ones) are open - People are not allowed to go outside without certification with valid motivation. - The police are patrolling the street fining everyone without a real necessity to go outside If according to this graph the US is where Italy was 11 days ago with the number of cases then the US government's response is much more weak and indecisive than in Italy's. - Medical system The most important difference between the US and Italy in this emergency is their medical system. Italy is often portrayed as a disorganized country, but the Italian medical system is one of the best in the world and the median age of the population can vouch for that. In Italy any health procedure is free and there is a wide network of physicians that are available to the general population for any necessity. This along with mandatory sick leave made people get tested and stay at home in the presence of any symptom of the virus. The top tier medical system is being expanded at incredible speed, with the help of one of the few companies in the world producing high-quality ventilators suitable to treat the sick. In the US the absence of medical leave couple with the high cost of medical care and absence of testing will make the situation much worse for the citizens. I encourage any reader to not take this emergency lightly, the markets have already proven that they aren't and will not go back to normal until nations will take the necessary measures to face this crisis. I believe that Italy, South Corea and many other countries that had a strong response to this crisis will at the end of this be rewarded for their sacrifice and if the US doesn't follow suit it wil be on the right trajectory to be overthrown by china on the global landscape.

"In Atul Gawandes‚Äô book ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù, he describes an interesting phenomenon. They were trying to figure out why some medical centers did much better than others in their care of complicated patients with serious problems, in this case cystic fibrosis, which basically has 100% mortality rate, but some people die when they‚Äôre 17 and some people die when they‚Äôre 40 or older. When they looked carefully at the centers that did well, they had an extremely hard time figuring out EXACTLY what they were doing right. That created a theory: ‚Äúplaces that do a good job at difficult, specific tasks often tend to do a good job at nearly everything‚Äú. So at a center with very long and excellent survivals it was never ‚Äúwe just do this one thing‚Äú is that they were better at everything: hiring good people, training good people, every day systems management for small issues, every day systems management for big problems issues, following best practices, and 100 other large and small things that made them ultimately successful. I wonder if the opposite is also true. These restaurants had major problems. Gordon came in for a week and fixed a few of them. But he likely didn‚Äôt fix the other 1100 things that they were doing wrong‚Ä¶. They may have 1100 undefined and untreated problems that just make them....bad at their jobs ...."	supertucci
"While people are going over the statistics of things, I‚Äôm also interested in looking at how the owners may have changed their attitudes about the restaurants after the show came in. Sure they got changed by Ramsay, and made so much better, but unfortunately there was a reason why those restaurants ended up being crappy in the first place, often due to the owners. My best guess is that a good number of these restaurants started to revert back to their bad habits again after Ramsay left and continued to spiral downward into crappiness again until they just weren‚Äôt making enough money to last anymore"	Modern-Otaku

"If it's this concentrated wouldn't that make [The ocean cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com)'s concept much more viable?"	Doppar
"How long you do give it until the Brits turn up and try colonise it?"	waffling_on_420
"What's the data from? Is this a bunch of tracking devices dropped across the ocean at once? It kinda suggests that the addition of garbage was a one time thing, but super cool visualization!"	trailnotfound
"Just out of interest, has anyone actually chucked a random gps tracker in to the sea to see how this kind of pollution moves? Would be really interesting to compare this model to an actual data source! \*(did lots of work in marine biology, and understand the benefits and limitations of models)"	_scottwar
"I learned recently that my perception of this problem was entirely incorrect. The garbage patch is not a big island of floating plastic bottles, etc. It's a big sparse conglomeration of micro plastics that if you sailed through, you'd barely even notice if at all. Not to say it's not a problem but that the problem is more difficult to tackle than you'd think."	Bourbonium
"If this is a simulation, with starting conditions of equally spread out garbage, what is the point of showing a date?"	Harmenski
"Couldn't ship move across with nets, and fish out the garbage patch? Just wondering, it's a lot of plastic to recycle."	ShootWalk2
"So this simulation makes it look like a giant island of garbage is floating in the ocean, but there isn't one. It's a shit load of micro plastics that can't be seen with the naked eye. This type of misleading information is why there are climate change deniers. You need to label this better"	a1d2a1m3
"It looks almost like Earth is saying, \"C'mon humans. I swept it all up in this nice lil pile for you. Now come clean this mess up!\""	jwilmes119
"Hey guys why dont we all stop blaming boomers and China and acknowledge that this is a human problem that we all need to fix."	EGO224
"Anyone familiar with [Friendly Floatees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees)? Very cool way of turning a negative into a positive."	TheGardiner
"I've always noticed that pattern of clustering happening to the last couple of cereal floating on the bowl of milk. Is it the same effect?"	Juansevi00
"I remember these huge ships getting paid to take garbage from Canada to far off countries for recycling. My gut feeling is that the real reason for the garbage patch is there is because the garbage was just dumped instead of being recycled."	WaywardWords
"Why does the simulation end up making the patch appear so small? Is it more densely packed, or just now digested by organisms and ending up on our plates?"	nomad80
"Notice the steady stream coming out of China. They take American recycling, which is poorly sorted and not cleaned, and if it is not economical to do it themselves they dump it in the ocean. I heard a podcast recently that said it best \"The trash archipelago is not because someone threw out their water bottle and it decided to join it's friends, it's because of mass dumping of rejected recycling by China\" Now that lots of Chinese recycling plants are no longer taking Americans poorly prepped recycling it would be a great opportunity in North America if someone had the capital"	Tastyfeesh
"this seems like bullshit... &#x200B; In January 1982, garbage was uniformly distributed throughout the pacific ocean? That's just fucking stupid."	gregregregregregregr
"What‚Äôs brilliant about that is it works like a visualization of pollution laws and awareness campaigns going into effect. By the late 1980s the lion‚Äôs share of trash is coming from East and Southeast Asia."	Wassayingboourns
